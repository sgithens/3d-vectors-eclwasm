Simple example to show the below error from 3d-vectors when quickloading.
Use ./make.sh in your ECL/WASM/Emscripten environment and load hello.html when done.  After clicking "Cancel" several times to get past the alert dialog, you should get the error below.

The main bits should just be 
  - hello.c and 
  - boxerdata/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/3d-vectors-20231021-git/
